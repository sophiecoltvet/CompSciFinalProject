How to use this program:
This program is designed to make scatter plots of any data you would like. In order to make the plot, you must enter numbers into the edit boxes for x values and y values. List the values with either spaces or commas between them, making sure the amount of numbers in each box is equal. All other edit boxes are optional, but you may use them to add more information to your plot. Make sure that if you use x limits or y limits, you enter values into both boxes, making the second number larger than the first. After pressing 'Plot!', you may change the color and line style of your plot with the radio buttons on the bottom right. If you would like to start over, you may press 'Reset' to clear the plot and all edit boxes. 
Sample data:
x-values: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
y-values: 12, 34, 56, 89, 40
x-limits: 0, 60
y-limits: 0, 100
